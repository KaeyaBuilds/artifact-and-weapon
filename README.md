How to interpret these tables?
1. The ranking only concerns R1 5* swords, R1 and R5 4* and 3* swords.
2. Artifact names "bc", "pf" and "bs" stand for "
Bloodstained Chivalry", "Pale Flame" and "Blizzard Strayer".
3. A mainstat like "ATK%/PHYS/CD" means given the sword, you want to use ATK% sand,
physical damage bonus goblet and crit damage circlet.
4. We make the assumptions that 20 rolls of your artifact substats go into ATK%, CR or CD.
And a substat like "0/18/2" means given the sword, you should aim to get 0 rolls on ATK%,
18 rolls on crit rate and 2 rolls on crit damage to maximize the damage output of that particular sword.
These rolls are not easy to achieve, they are just a general guideline of where you want the rolls to go.
5. The average damage in two tables above are calculated for the following Kaeya rotation:
```E > Q > N2C x 2 > E > N2C x 2``` with 10 Q hits. N2C here is normal attacks 1, 2 plus a charged attack.
6. We assume all of the weapons are at level 90, C0 Kaeya at level 80 ascended and Kaeya's talents are all at level 8.
We don't consider the team comps. And we assume on average the ATK% substat roll is 4.975%, CR is 3.3% and CD is 6.6%.
