# The ultimate Kaeya artifact and weapon ranking
We provide comprehensive lists of the best builds for physical and cryo Kaeya.
Since some of the presented results may look counterintuitive, please check out the sections below for [how to use our tables](#how-to-interpret-and-use-the-tables) and [common questions](#common-questions).

## Top physical Kaeya builds ([full list](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/best_builds_for_phys_rotation.tsv))

This is optimized for Kaeya's full DPS, which includes his normal/charged attacks and elemental skill/burst. If you want to optimize for his normal/charged attacks only, check out the [AA1](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/best_builds_for_AA1.tsv) and [CA](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/best_builds_for_CA.tsv) links in the [full lists](#full-lists) section.

## Top cryo Kaeya builds ([full list](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/best_builds_for_cryo_rotation.tsv))

Similar to the table above, this is optimized for Kaeya's full DPS, the only difference is that we also assume 100% cryo infusion uptime on Kaeya's normal/charged attacks from Chongyun.

## How to interpret and use the tables
1. A mainstat like "ATK%/PHYS/CD" means given the sword, you want to use ATK% sand,
physical damage bonus goblet and crit damage circlet for a damage optimized build.
2. We make the assumption that 20 rolls of your artifact substats go into ATK%, CR or CD.
And a substat like "0/18/2" in the table means given the sword, you should aim to roll 0 in ATK%,
18 in crit rate and 2 in crit damage to maximize the damage output of that particular sword.
These rolls are not easy to achieve, they are just a general guideline for where you want the rolls to go.
3. Artifact names "bc", "pf" and "bs" stand for "Bloodstained Chivalry", "Pale Flame" and "Blizzard Strayer".
"4-bs frozen" means 4-piece Blizzard Strayer set and the enemy is frozen.
5. The average damage in the two tables above are calculated for the following Kaeya rotation:
```E > Q > N2C > N2C > E > N2C > N2C``` with 10 Q hits. N2C here is normal attacks 1, 2 plus a charged attack.
"Average damage" is averaged over crit and no crit.
5. We assume all of the weapons are at level 90, C0 Kaeya at level 80 ascended and Kaeya's talents are all at level 8.
We don't consider the team comps, e.g. no cryo resonance. And we assume on average the ATK% artifact substat roll is 4.975%, CR is 3.3% and CD is 6.6%.
6. The lists on this page only contain R1 5-star swords, R1 and R5 4-star and 3-star swords. See our [master table](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/master_weapon_artifact_sheet.tsv) for all of the refinements of all of the swords.

## Common questions
1. **Q**: Do you have build suggestions for higher refinement 5* swords? **A**: Yes, please consult the [master table](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/master_weapon_artifact_sheet.tsv) for all of the refinements of all of the swords given all of the artifact sets.
2. **Q**: Why do you recommend ATK% goblet for many of the physical Kaeya swords in your table?
**A**: The table above is optimized for Kaeya's full DPS, which includes his elemental skill and burst, and they favor ATK% goblet.
If you want to optimize for physical Kaeya's [normal](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/best_builds_for_AA1.tsv)/[charged](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/best_builds_for_CA.tsv) attacks only, we always recommend physical damage bonus goblet.
3. **Q**: Why do you recommend crit damage not crit rate circlet for Aquila Favonia? **A**: For swords that do not have a crit secondary stat, you can typically build CD circlet and CR in substats or vice versa, and these two builds should be very close. In the case of Aquila Favonia, when the artifact substats are optimized, the "CD circlet/CR substat" build is only 0.0042% better than the "CR circlet/CD substat" build for physical Kaeya and 0.0025% better for cryo Kaeya. Because we only show "the best" artifact build for each weapon, we recommended CD circlet for Aquila. You can use our [master table](https://github.com/KaeyaBuilds/artifact-and-weapon/blob/main/results/master_weapon_artifact_sheet.tsv) to find out the actual gap between the recommended builds on this page and the builds that you are interested in.
4. **Q**: Will adding Kaeya's C1 and cyro resonance change your results? **A**: They will change (1) the absolute values for the average damage output; (2) Our mainstat/substat investment recommendations, especially for cryo Kaeya. However, they will not change the rankings of the swords. The rule of thumb is, when you have C1/cryo resonance, you can distribute some of our recommended substat points from CR into the second most desired substat, like CD in the case of "0/18/2", or equally into ATK% and CD in a case like "3/14/3". The number of CR points to take away entirely depends on your cryo uptime.
